## List of External Ontologies

* [OMG: Ontology for Managing Geometry](https://w3id.org/omg) by *[Anna Wagner](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anna_Wagner13) and [Mathias Bonduel](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mathias_Bonduel)*: linking between concepts (e.g. a building element) and their geometry description(s), between related geometry descriptions and between geometry descriptions and related properties. 

* [FOG: File Ontology for Geometry formats](https://w3id.org/fog) by *[Mathias Bonduel](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mathias_Bonduel) and [Anna Wagner](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anna_Wagner13)*: extension of OMG for geometry schema specific relations to geometry descriptions (e.g. OBJ, Revit geometry, E57, DWG, etc.)

* [BPO: Building Product Ontology](https://w3id.org/bpo) *[Anna Wagner](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anna_Wagner13)*

* [IFC-PROPS](https://github.com/maximelefrancois86/props) by *[Maxime Lefrançois](http://maxime-lefrancois.info/me#)*: list of properties extracted from IFC4 psets

* [IFC-PRODUCT](https://github.com/pipauwel/product) by *[Pieter Pauwels](https://www.ugent.be/ea/architectuur/en/contact/staff-members/pieter-pauwels)*: extended version of the minimal LBD PRODUCT ontology, based on IFC product definitions

* [Brick Ontology](https://github.com/BrickSchema/brick/) by [Brick Consortium](https://brickschema.org/): Defines HVAC, lighting, spatial and electrical concepts and relationships for the purposes of contextualizing data sources in buildings. Provides a high-level topological and compositional view of buildings and their subsystems. Primary contact is [Gabe Fierro](https://gtf.fyi).

* [RealEstateCore - REC Ontology](https://github.com/RealEstateCore/rec) RealEstateCore is an open-source ontology for building-related data and applications. The model includes the ontology, an API specification and a message format. It cover all parts of a real estate for proptech use cases, not only devices and technical systems but also business and user activities.

* [MM: Metrics Model](https://w3id.org/mm) by *[Hervé Pruvost](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Herve-Pruvost)*: consists of a taxonomy and vocabularies about quantities, quantity kinds and key metrics e.g. KPIs (Key Performance Indicator) or KRIs (Key Risk Indicator) used by engineers in building design, HVAC and building automation.

* [ESIM: Energy System Information Model](https://w3id.org/esim) by *[Pit Stenzel](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pit-Stenzel) and [Hervé Pruvost](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Herve-Pruvost)*: decribes energy systems at both building and urban levels, including automation and control systems. It provides a functional, structural and physical description of energy systems into a metadata structure and allow for linking additional operational data.

* [BAF: Building Automation Functions](https://w3id.org/baf) by *[Hervé Pruvost](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Herve-Pruvost)*: catalogue of generic function blocs used by BACS (building automation and control systems) designers and provided as RDF/OWL graph incl. their types of I/O, dependencies and parameters.

* [RISK: The Risk Ontology](https://w3id.org/risk) by *[Hervé Pruvost](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Herve-Pruvost)*: formalizes concepts from the field of risk management applied in contruction and building operation for e.g. FDD (Fault Detection and Diagnosis), uncertainty-resilient processes or predictive maintenance. 

* HVAC ontology

* PROJECT ontology
